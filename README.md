# 👋 Hi, I'm Maria Jose! 

I’m an AI enthusiast who took an unconventional path: starting in **Law** before falling in love with the world of **Artificial Intelligence**. I recently wrapped up my Master’s with honors (**110/110 cum laude**), and I’m now diving deep into the ML lifecycle as a Trainee.

### 🛠️ What I'm working with lately
*I'm currently a **Jr. Data Scientist Trainee at Heroes B.V.**, where I'm getting my hands dirty with:*
* **Cloud & MLOps:** Building and deploying models using **Azure, Databricks, and MLflow**.
* **Building Solutions:** Writing **Python** to solve real-world problems and creating scalable data pipelines.
* **Computer Vision:** Experimenting with **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow** to see what's possible.

### 🧪 My "Learning Lab" projects
*I use these projects to test out new tools and document my growth:*
* **[Emotion Vision](https://github.com/nuna-bit/Emotion-Vision):** A real-time recognition system I built using a CNN and OpenCV.
* **[Azure Language Assistant](https://github.com/nuna-bit/azure-speech-language-assistant):** Exploring **Azure AI Foundry** for speech and translation.
* **[CNN_CIFAR10](https://github.com/nuna-bit/CNN_CIFAR10):** A foundational project focusing on image classification and model optimization.

*...and several others! You can find my full collection of experiments in my [Repositories](https://github.com/nuna-bit?tab=repositories) tab.*
